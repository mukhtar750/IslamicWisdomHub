Hello AI Team! I'm embarking on a mission to revolutionize access to knowledge and Islamic wisdom through a digital platform for my library, Al Hikmah Library (مكتبة الحكمة). I envision a user-friendly mobile app (Android & iOS) and a complementary website that will allow our community in Nigeria, and beyond to discover and engage with our collection. The platform needs to support both English and Arabic, with 'مكتبة الحكمة' prominently featured (perhaps as a logo or in the header in Arabic).
My vision includes:
 * A comprehensive digital library catalog: Users should be able to browse, search, and view details of our physical and potentially digital book collection.
 * User accounts: With personalized dashboards featuring a personal 'bookshelf' of borrowed and saved items.
 * Admin/Librarian Dashboard: A secure backend to manage the book catalog (uploading, editing, deleting), manage user accounts, track borrowing, and potentially generate reports.
 * AI-Powered Islamic Knowledge Assistant: A key feature is an integrated AI that can answer Islamic questions with references to the Quran, Hadith, and Sunnah (in both English and Arabic).
 * (For the App): Potential for offline access to borrowed digital books.
My request is for your expertise as:
 * UI/UX Designer AI: Help me design intuitive and visually appealing interfaces for both the mobile app and the website, keeping in mind ease of use for a diverse audience and incorporating Arabic elements tastefully.
 * Full-Stack Developer AI: Outline the technical architecture, suggest suitable technologies, and guide me through the development process for both the frontend (mobile app and website) and the backend (database, API, admin panel).
 * AI Engineer: Provide guidance on integrating a reliable AI model for answering Islamic questions, including data sources, training methodologies (if necessary), and ensuring the accuracy and proper referencing of information from the Quran, Hadith, and Sunnah.
Consider the local context of Nigeria, and the importance of reliable Islamic knowledge. Let's work together to build a valuable and impactful digital library for Al Hikmah Library! What are your initial thoughts and recommendations to kickstart this project
